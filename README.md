<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

While many teenagers pick up sexual health information from sources other than schools like parents, peers, social media and pop culture, sometimes that information is not accurate or it is biased and can be misleading. This has led to an increasing demand from young people for reliable information, which prepares them for a safe, productive and fulfilling life.

When delivered well, Sex Education responds to this demand, empowering young people to make informed decisions about relationships, sexuality and navigate a world where genderbased violence, gender inequality, early and unintended pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) still pose serious risks to their health and well-being. It’s also an essential tool to help them learn about a broad range of topics related to biological, psychological and sociocultural perspectives of individual beings. It just needs to be delivered in an age-appropriate and engaging way based on science and facts. Equally, a lack of high-quality, age- and developmentally-appropriate sexual and relationship education may leave children and young people vulnerable to harmful sexual behaviors and sexual exploitation.

<!-- Motivatiion THE PROJECT -->
## Motivation

The continuous rise in rates of sexual harassment and violence especially during covid lockdown and present times, represents an alarming situation that needs to be pulled up by the roots. Due to conservatism and social beliefs, Ethiopia is yet to introduce sex education effectively. As young people ourselves, we wanted to pioneer this conversation in our country and address some misconceptions about it. This platform will be the bridges the gap between the youth and the education they should have.

<!-- Motivatiion THE PROJECT -->
## Scope and Limitations

With the realization of alarming reproductive health/gender issues in the population and the need to propagate awareness among young generation regarding these issues, we are trying to implement countrywide sexual health education programs through our website targeting mainly the adolescent population in Ethiopia. knowing our topic is still widely debated throughout the country, we plan on addressing the outcome of sexual health education programs.
The scope of our program is intended to include people of different age and gender giving more emphasis on the teenage youths.

Sexual health issues are intensely private and extremely frowned upon by strict social norms. Thus, education of masses about such sensitive issue becomes too complex a matter to implement. Hence, of course, the sexual health education campaign needs to be dealt sensibly with exchange of ideas and collaboration with all educational stakeholders. As compared to other affluent countries like USA the societal norms and cultural fabric in our country is much more different as far as the sexual health issues are concerned. Our cultural norms are mostly closed to the issues to be discussed in the family or at the school and are considered to be a taboo.

Lack of resources (i.e. educational materials and contents done on such issues) can also be mentioned.
We are very aware of these limitations but our main objective is to increase open-mindedness and create awareness among our society regarding sexual health issues using our platform which is expected to bring interactions among peoples of different ages and experience.
